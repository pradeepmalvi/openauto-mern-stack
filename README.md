# Steps to Start the Application in a Local Environment
The following steps describe how to start the frontend and backend of the application in a local environment.

## Frontend
Change the current directory to the frontend folder by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

`cd /client`

Install the required dependencies for the frontend by running the following command: 

`npm install`

Start the development server by running the following command:

`npm start`

The application will now be running in development mode and accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


You will see live updates as you make changes to the code. You can also view any lint errors in the console.


## Backend
Change the current directory to the backend folder by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:


`cd /backend`

Install the required dependencies for the backend by running the following command:

`npm install`

Start the server by running the following command:


`npm start`


The server will now be running on Port 5000 and accessible at http://localhost:5000/api in your browser.

Note: Make sure you have the required dependencies, such as Node.js, installed on your local machine before starting the application.
